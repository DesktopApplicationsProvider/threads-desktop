    <h2>Desktop Experience Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      The Threads Desktop UI is designed to give a familiar and powerful desktop experience. Like other desktop
      clients of social platforms, this application aims to bring:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean, responsive feed layout you’d expect on desktop environments.</li>
      <li>Multiple views such as <em>Following</em> and <em>For You</em> feeds side-by-side.</li>
      <li>Automatic updates and real-time feed refresh without manual reloads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some desktop views are inspired by the web and app interfaces of Threads’ own desktop experience — such as
      multi-column feeds and pinned content panes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
