    <h2>Troubleshooting & Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the installer doesn’t run, right-click the file and choose “Run as Administrator” — this often resolves
        permission issues during installation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure your operating system meets the minimum requirements (Windows 10/11, 64-bit system, up-to-date updates).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have issues logging in after installation, make sure your Threads account is set up and working via the
        mobile app or the official Threads web interface first.
      </li>
