    <h1>How to Use Threads Desktop</h1>
    <p>
      This guide shows you how to interact with <strong>Threads Desktop</strong> — from logging in and navigating the interface
      to creating content and engaging with posts.

    <h2>1. Signing In</h2>
    <p>
      To start using Threads Desktop, launch the app after installation and log in with your Instagram credentials (since Threads
      uses Instagram accounts to authenticate users).
    </p>
    <p>
      *If you encounter issues logging in (e.g., being redirected to a QR code or login prompt), make sure your Instagram account
      has a password set and isn’t solely linked via Facebook, as this can interfere with login workflows.*  
      (Community tip: some users solved login problems by adjusting their Instagram security settings before attempting desktop login.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

    <h2>2. Navigating the Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Once logged in, you’ll be greeted with the main Threads interface — typically a timeline of posts from people you follow
      or suggestions of content. The layout is designed to resemble a familiar social feed, optimized for desktop screens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threads also lets you switch between view modes (e.g., “Following” and “For You”) to customize how content appears in your feed,
      similar to the official Threads web experience. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    <h2>3. Creating a Thread</h2>
    <p>
      To post a new thread:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the “New Post” or “Compose” button in the top area of the interface.</li>
      <li>Type your message — keep it engaging and concise!</li>
      <li>You can include photos, videos, emojis, or links if supported by the client.</li>
      <li>Press “Post” to publish your thread to your profile and your followers’ feeds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In general, on Threads platforms you create content by clicking the composer, writing your message, and adding any media you want to
      include. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

    <h2>4. Interacting with Posts</h2>
    <p>
      Once posts appear in your feed, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Like</strong> a thread by clicking the heart icon.</li>
      <li><strong>Comment</strong> to join conversations on a post.</li>
      <li><strong>Repost / Quote</strong> to share it with your followers with your own commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These interactions help you engage with your community and get more visibility. Most desktop interfaces follow similar interaction patterns to
      the web or mobile versions. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

    <h2>5. Searching & Following Users</h2>
    <p>
      Use the search bar (typically at the top or in a navigation pane) to find users or keywords you’re interested in. Once you find
      someone you want to follow, hover or click their profile and tap “Follow” to add them to your feed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes it easy to explore topics and build up a feed of content that matters to you.

    <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep threads visual and engaging — adding a photo or video often increases interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use relevant hashtags and mentions (<code>@username</code>) to expand your reach.
      </li>
      <li>
        Post consistently to grow your audience and maintain visibility in followers’ feeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the official desktop client lacks certain features, you may also use the official Threads web app via your browser in the meantime. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
